My first daughter, Georgia, and I, made up a silly story the other day after our evening walk.  I was inspired to write it out with her and illustrate it.  She's too young to really illustrate it, and I'm a terrible artist, so I leaned heavily on Midjourney...  Anyway - here's the first story.  Hopefully we'll do more of these.
