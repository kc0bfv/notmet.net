<a href="https://github.com/kc0bfv/FrontPorch">Front Porch</a> is an open source Python project which sets up a simple file upload and download server.  The client is your webbrowser.  FrontPorch uses WebSockets to perform file uploads, and thus gets around several issues with current web-based upload options.  It implements its own very basic webserver instead of using Python's built in server.  Check it out at GitHub.
