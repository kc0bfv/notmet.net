A few years ago I had the pleasure of teaching a Python Course for programmers - folks who already knew some programming language, and maybe even a little Python.  We worked through the syntax quickly, and got on to advanced topics and things they'd need in their very specific day jobs.  This was a blast for me - I enjoy teaching folks things, and I enjoy Python, so everything about this was fun.  I was invited back a second year, and again the students and I had a great time.

If you're interested in using the materials, you can find links to all of it [over on GitHub](https://github.com/kc0bfv/Python2Lecture).  This material was geared towards Python 2.

In spring 2020 I'm teaching a beginners programming class at Idaho State University, and the language we'll use is Python 3.  The professors there already have a great curriculum, but I've adopted it for an online course with auto-graded assignments.  I'll be covering one online section, and one in-person section at two locations (via video).  No materials for that are publicly available, but if you want to take the course it's CS1181.
