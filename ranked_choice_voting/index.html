        <p>I became interested in Ranked Choice Voting several years ago when I realized the most common US voting systems were really underwhelming.  I see this most clearly in elections that have several candidates, and I hear it most clearly when folks talk about how they cannot vote for the person they&rsquo;re most interested in due to the spoiler effect.</p>
<p>Researching other voting methods - Ranked Choice has significant advantages over our current system, addresses lots of issues I see in our system, and is extremely compatible with our legal frameworks.  So, I started to try to advocate for it.</p>
<p>Ranked Choice Restaurants is a webapp I created to show folks how easy Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) is.  Apparently, a common concern and complaint of RCV is that it&rsquo;s too complicated.  I&rsquo;ve seen that it can be made complicated, but at its core you&rsquo;re simply ranking your preferences, just as you might when someone asks you your favorite coffee shops in DC.  I wanted this app to be that easy to use.</p>
<p>Ranked Choice Restaurants works great on mobile, has a simple easily-styled design, and walks people through voting.  I user-tested it twice, fixing the problems people reported the first time (no significant problems reported the second time&hellip;).</p>
<p>Then I tried to get three newspapers to use this app for their annual local &ldquo;Best-Of&rdquo; competitions.  I targeted papers in my area, contacted their feature reps directly by phone and email, and got little call-back.  Unfortunately I just didn&rsquo;t have time to stand on folks&rsquo; desks, and then I had to move, and then I didn&rsquo;t have much more time to work on this.</p>
<p>The demo is available over at <a href="https://vote.notmet.net/">https://vote.notmet.net/</a>, and the source code is at <a href="https://github.com/kc0bfv/RankedChoiceRestaurants">GitHub</a>.  Please let me know if you&rsquo;re interested in using this, as I&rsquo;d be happy to talk you through customization.  The demo deployment is on shared server resources, so a dedicated deployment would be much quicker than the demo.</p>
<p>Also - I curate current events around Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) and post them to the <a href="https://wt.social/wt/ranked-choice-voting-in-the-us">WT-Social US RCV Subwiki</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rankedchoice/">the-social-network-who-must-not-be-named</a>.</p>
